It also includes general Internet outages, failures in the customer's infrastructure or connectivity, and disruptions in computer and telecommunications systems. Additionally, unauthorized modifications to the service by individuals not associated with Momba, as well as malicious activities like network intrusions or denial-of-service attacks, are considered part of Excused Downtime. These conditions are categorized as circumstances beyond Momba's control.\n"

An Order Form is a crucial document that specifies the financial terms, including fees and final prices, for the services and products ordered. It is essential for the parties to sign a mutually agreed-upon Order Form before commencing any Subscription or Professional Services. The Order Form may include a Product Overview, which describes the expected performance and features of the Subscription Service and details the ordered products. The Product Overview can be attached to or referenced in the Order Form.\n\nMomba guarantees that during the Subscription Term, the Customer's production instances of the Subscription Service will conform to the Product Overview if it is attached to the Order. Additionally, the Order Form must include the Customer's VAT or GST identification numbers for the country where the business is established. If a Customer issues a Purchase Order, it must match the full amount specified in the Order Form.\n\nMomba may delay issuing service credits until they reach a minimum threshold of one thousand U.S. dollars, as agreed upon in the Order Form. Prices stated in each Order Form are final, ensuring clarity and agreement on the costs involved.\n"
